# Skateboard Project

This project is a unreal programming task for Blue Gravity Studios based on [this requirements](https://www.notion.so/Unreal-Programmer-Task-9db9f9087b174ad6a37b42351dd263ef?pvs=21).

The project contemplates a simple skateboarding controller, where the player can accelerate, break, lean left/right, and jump. The player can also toggle between regular walking controllers, and toggle between a fixed or free look camera while skateboarding.

## Input

### Walking

- W/A/S/D - Walk

### Skateboarding

- S - Break (like the skater is pressing his feet on the ground to add friction)

- E - Toggles between fixed or free look camera modes

### Other

- Q - Toggles between skateboarding and walking

### General Information
